Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and specifying actions taken according to the conditions.

Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.

Sr.No. 	Statement & Description
1 	if statements
	An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
2 	if...else statements
	An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is FALSE.
3 	nested if statements
	You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).

"if" statements
The if statement contains a logical expression using which data is compared and a decision is made based on the result of the comparison.

if expression:
   statement(s)

If the boolean expression evaluates to TRUE, then the block of statement(s) inside the if statement is executed. If boolean expression evaluates to FALSE, then the first set of code after the end of the if statement(s) is executed. 

Example
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/python


name = input("Enter the name : ") 

if name == "joseph":
    print("Your name is %s" %(name))

Python IF...ELIF...ELSE Statements

An else statement can be combined with an if statement. An else statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.

The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at most only one else statement following if.
Syntax

The syntax of the if...else statement is −

if expression:
   statement(s)
else:
   statement(s)
------------------------------
Example
name = input("Enter the name : ") 

if name == "joseph":
    print("Your name is %s" %(name))
else:
    print("Your name not here")
    
----------------------------------
The elif Statement
Python nested IF statements
The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.

Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional. However, unlike else, for which there can be at most one statement, there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.
syntax

if expression1:
   statement(s)
elif expression2:
   statement(s)
elif expression3:
   statement(s)
else:
   statement(s)

Core Python does not provide switch or case statements as in other languages, but we can use if..elif...statements to simulate switch case as follows −

Example
------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/python
name = input("Enter the name : ") 

if name == "joseph":
    print("Your name is %s" %(name))

elif name == "prashant":
    print("Your name is %s" %(name))
    
elif name == "manoj":
    print("Your name is %s" %(name))
    
elif name == "azzam":
    print("Your name is %s" %(name))

else:
    print("Please edit the above code and add your name ")
